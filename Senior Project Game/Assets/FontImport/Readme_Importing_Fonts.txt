Hello,

If you are interested in using a new font, or finding a specific font for a specific vibe 
Here are the rules:

1. Each imported font must have their own folder within this "FontImport" folder

2. That folder must be named after the font's name

3. The font in question must be public domain and absolutely free to use 


Easy to remember! :D

If you want specific instructions on how you can find/get new fonts to be usable in this project
Here are the steps:

1. Go to https://www.dafont.com/ 

2. Make sure to click the "100% Free" sortby option, in the "more options" drop-down list

3. Pick a font you like, press download

4. Extract the compressed file into a newly created folder here in the FontImport folder, named after the font

5. Right click the extracted font and navigate to: Create >> TextMeshPro >> Font Asset


Easy to follow! :D

Note: 
    The given example site is just one possible options/place to get fonts. You can get fonts elsewhere, but
    I used this site for its simplicity, and its readily available PubliC Domain fonts you can find.
